            At Too Good To Go, we dream of a planet with no food waste.
            <br />
            <br />
            Imagine if there was something we could all change today that would
            reduce global warming by 8%. That’s how much food waste contributes
            to the climate crisis, and yet we continue to waste 40% of all the
            food produced in the US. We’re on a mission to change this.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our app connects consumers to surplus food from local restaurants
            and grocery stores, such as pastries, fresh produce, sushi and more,
            which would otherwise be thrown away to make room for the next batch
            of goods. Founded in 2016, we’ve saved nearly 50 million meals
            across 15 countries, which adds up to 200 million pounds of food.
            We’re proud of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re just starting
            our US journey.

            Your mission
            <br />
            <br />
            We're looking for an enthusiastic, dedicated and self-driven PR
            Specialist to drive pitching efforts regionally and nationally,
            targeting numerous outlets in the F&B, lifestyle and B2B realm,
            along with reporters and appropriate outlets that cover the
            intersection of tech, climate and business.
            <br />
            <br />
            This role will report to the PR and Marketing Manager and be a part
            of Too Good To Go’s close-knit, dynamic and agile U.S. marketing
            team. This is a unique opportunity to gain in-house experience,
            <br />
            <br />
            while also maintaining a lot of the fast-paced agency work, i.e.
            writing tailored, targeted pitches, regular check-ins with the
            marketing and leadership team, etc. While we have many organic
            stories to tell, we also want the PR Specialist to be proactive and
            creative in how we draw attention to America's massive food waste
            issue, drive awareness to our app as a solution and communicate our
            impact against climate change.
